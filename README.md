# John-Conways-Game-of-Life
This is a Java representation of John Conway's game of life. 
The program requires a state in which you want to see of the game and the starting state of the game in the format of 0's for dead cells and 1's for live cells.
The resulting output will be the number of live cells(1's) at the inputted state.
The program uses a 20 int 1D array so the state of the game/ input should be 20 0's and 1's but can be envisioned as a 2D 4x5 array
